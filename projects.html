                <p>This is a project that I did for a course called "Computational Physics". As said in the title, this code is to run N-body simulations using Particle-Mesh Method. I decided keep it as an ongoing project as there are things that I would like to do to improve it.</p>
                <p>If not apparent, I kept this abbreviation for the project to keep up with the tradition of such weird abbreviations in Astrophysics. Take abbreviations such as H0LiCOW and BATMAN, for example. I swear, 10 mins of your life will be well-spent in going through such abbreviations at <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~gpetitpas/Links/Astroacro.html">Dumb Or Overly Forced Astronomical Acronyms Site (or DOOFAAS)</a>.</p>
